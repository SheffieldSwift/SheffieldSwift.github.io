# SheffieldSwift.github.io

## Setting up

Make sure you have Ruby and installed Jekyll:

    gem install jekyll
    
You can then work on the files and see the site locally via:

    jekyll serve
    
After changing the files, you can just commit and push to master for GitHub to automatically update the site.
